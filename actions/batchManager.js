 * The BatchManager class helps manage a collection of batches for a single process. Its functions include:
 * 1. Create batches based on the number of batch files configuration.
 * 2. Maintain a manifest file for the collection of batches,
 *    which includes details such as the last batch and associated activation IDs.
 * 3. Track the current batch in the manager and provide helper methods for management.
 * 4. Offer cleanup functions for managing any necessary cleanup tasks.
 * Some near term tasks to be done
 * 1. Clean of processed files needs to be handled instead of full cleanup
 * 2. Stop and resume needs to be implemented.
 * 3. Retry of failed files needs to be implemented which might need rebatching
 * 4. The execution/triggering of action is out of this (i.e. promoteBatch).
 *   There needs to be enhacement to handle this within this e.g. Batch execution stargergy should be implemented.
